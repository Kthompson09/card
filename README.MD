## Project overview 
## what i learned 
The project is attempting to deliver a digital business card for my own personal brand, which is graphic design. It should function as a way to help direct people to my email, portfolio, and Instagram. It does this by having a simple layout, with clickable links and interactive elements.
During the process of making this, I learned a number of things like standards for designing websites using Visual Studio Code, SVG sizes, and how to understand the overall layout structure and usage of web design.
To develop my own personal brand, I took inventory of what and who I am as a graphic designer, compiling all aspects of my personality and art style, and the overall design themes that make me stand out. I came up with the statement: "I am a unique and bold graphic designer who delivers visually compelling work that is designed with the consumer's goals in mind."
This was my first webpage design, and it was a challenge to get over the software barrier. However, I believe with that, I managed to actually understand, learn, and develop something I like.
## Accessibility
I addressed accessibility by adding alternative text to all my SVGs and clickable links.
## Features, Fonts, and Design Mockup
The problem it solves is the lack of my digital reach, enabling me to be searched and potentially leading me to prospective jobs.
My project stands out as it is a unique personal brand that encompasses my style and brand, alongside showcasing my understanding of typographic layout and the use of shape.
The fonts I used include VTKS-Smash for the header, Allerta Stencil for the subheader, and Allerta for the "body"/list text. What led me to choose these fonts (or any stylistic choice I made for that matter) is that they aligned with my branding statement. These fonts are bold and stylized, and they work well together to create good typographical hierarchy.
I created mockups by doing a series of hand-drawn drafts and then picking the best and most cohesive one to create a mockup in Figma, which I then actualized in Visual Studio Code.
